    3. IMPORTANT difference, In HTML, while declaring the class name we do it like this,
            <li class="note">some text...</li>
        but in React, it's className sttribute instead
            <li className='note'>

    Improved error message:-
        1. Added a new component called Notification that can prepare an error message
        2. the code is in extras/part2b folder
        3. Sample code can be found here

    Inline styles:-
        1. Inline styles are allowed in React

        2. the values in css that are string are in quotes
        3. An example footer is added in the code
        4. Read more about the pseudo-classes here, TODO
            https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes
        5. Sample code in github can be found here,
            https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/part2-notes/tree/part2-8
        6. IMPORTANT - React philosophy
            using inline styles, keep the logical component and all the required stuff in one place
            Instead of splitting them into various files, so the single component can be reused.
